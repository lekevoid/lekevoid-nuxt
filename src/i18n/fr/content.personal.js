		horror: `<h3 class="subtitle">L'horreur me fascine</h3>
					<p>Horror, like mythology, serves humans in several ways: it helps cope with what is not known or understood; it enables the exploration of things that are considered forbidden, taboo or "bad"... and most of all, at least for me, it shows what we all stand to lose, when we accept delusions as truths, and when we lose sight of our humanity or refuse to see the monsters that are within each of us.</p>
					<p><b>Things the eldritch horrors have whispered to my ear</b>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Life has no meaning or value intrinsically, it falls to me to give it both.</li>
						<li>The universe doesn't care about my mistakes or successes.</li>
						<li>Entropy claims us all.</li>
					</ul>`,
		quantum: `<h3 class="subtitle">Je suis un geek pour le quantique</h3>
					<p>Few things excite my imagination like the quantum world. A world where <em>common sense</em> breaks down. Where our daily experience informs <i>zilch</i> about what is truly going on. Where <em>objectivity</em> seems to meet <em>consciousness</em>. Where beautiful <em>stories</em> are born, at the crossroads of magic and poetry.</p>
					<p><b>What's I've seen by peeking at the Planck scale</b>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Le monde est <em style="font-variant:small-caps;">b̸̧͖̀̅̌̾͠i̵͕͇͎̱͌͑̌͝z̵̥̩̞͚̓à̷̠̜̗̬́ͅr̴͙̠̃̇̒r̴̡̥̥̖̋̄e̵̡̨̛̩͖̗̎̇</em>.</li>
						<li>It's a running gag with my partner, that we could have existed in any of the "<i>alternate realities</i>" where we never met, or where split apart. Yet here we are. Let's make <i>this</i> reality what we want it to be.</li>
						<li>Entropy claims us all.</li>
					</ul>`,
		soldier: `<h3 class="subtitle">J'aime les épées</h3>
					<p>Swords have been part of my life for as long as I can remember, from the kid watching Power Rangers and playing Zelda, to the adult taking classes in <em>HEMA</em> and <em>kali</em>.</p>
					<p><b>Lessons I gleamed from the blade</b>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Improvement comes with consistency and in tiny increments.</li>
						<li>Purpose is the difference between growing and thrashing around.</li>
					</ul>`,
		wizard: `<h3 class="subtitle">Je suis un magicien!</h3>
					<p>A wise man named Daniel Parisien, who was my mentor for a short while, once said that <em>programming is the closest we'll ever get to magic</em>. <i>(He's probably not the first to say it but I'm crediting him anyways)</i></p>
					<p>I've studied the actual occult arts and found this to ring true. I find a <em>resonance</em> with code that can almost be qualified mystical: the <em>sanctum</em>-like quality of my working space. The books by Robert Martin and cheatsheets akin to as many <em>grimoires</em> and <em>scrolls</em> from which to unearth some hidden lore. And most of all, the duality of <em>esotericism</em> and <em>clarity</em> of well-written code.</p>
					<p><b>How the <i>magic</i> of programming has affected my outlook on life</b>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The laws of programming are limiting to the apprentice, freeing to the adept. One meaningful aim is to understand when to respect the rules of the system, when to circumvent them, and when to surpass them.</li>
						<li>Every problem has a solution. Find tools that you can use and get to it.</li>
						<li>A poor worker blames their tool, it's true. Yet bad tools <i>can</i> destroy the best worker.</li>
					</ul>`,
